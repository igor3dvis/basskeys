This folder will have platform independent (JS only) code.
The idea is that this folder can be copied and atleast the
business utils can be used on the web/server.

1. Enums (aka constants) - both business and general
2. Utils - functions both business and general

example - dateToString, positionifyNumber, maxDecimal, timeAgo etc

In a nutshell, pure functions and constants.
